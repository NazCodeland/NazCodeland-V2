  This is an introduction to a series of posts on design patterns in software
  development - patterns in the creational, structural and behavioral
  categories. It's a way for me to help myself learn better by documenting it
  and to have a future reference in my own words. Each post will include
  explanations, analogies, and code examples using Javascript and Python.
