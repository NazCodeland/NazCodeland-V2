    	One of the delights of working with Ruby and jQuery is the ability to chain methods, enabling
    	you to conveniently invoke multiple methods on the same target. In jQuery, for example, most
    	methods return a jQuery object, so you can build a chain of methods where every new method
    	operates on the previous target. This enables you to update some styles, run an animation, and
    	update an attribute, all without querying for that element over and over again:
    </p>
    <pre>
    $(".menu")
    .css("color", "#fff")
    .data("mode", "light")
    .fadeIn();

</pre>
	<p>
		Short and sweet. If you’ve updated the styles of an object with vanilla JavaScript, you might’ve
		been annoyed about the fact that you can’t chain style changes, and so you have to do something
		like this:
	</p>
	<pre>
	let menu = document.querySelector(".menu");
	menu.style.color = "#fff";
	menu.style.backgroundColor = "#000";
	menu.style.opacity = "1";
</pre>

    <p>
    	There are a few different ways of making this more convenient, but the other day I started
    	thinking about if it would be possible to use a Proxy object (at the time of writing, global
    	support is at 92.76%) to enable chaining of style changes. Turns out, it’s relatively easy.
    	We’ll walk through how to create a light-weight Proxy handler that will enable us to shorten the
    	code above to this:
    </p>
    <pre>
    style(".menu")
    .color("#fff")
    .backgroundColor("#000")
    .opacity("1");

</pre>
	<p>
		We’ll use roughly the same strategy as jQuery does: we’ll fetch the style object of an element
		and wrap it with a Proxy in order to intercept (trap) all get calls to that style object, take
		the accessed property and update its value if a value is passed, and then return the Proxy
		handler wrapping the style object again, enabling us to build an infinite chain of commands.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since we’ll repurpose the get method to also act as a setter, we’ll retain the get functionality
		by returning the value of a property if you don’t pass any arguments to the function (i.e.
		you’ll get a value through style(".menu").color() rather than style(".menu").color). Here’s the
		gist of the technique:
	</p>

    <p>Let’s break it down, and quickly walk through how a Proxy works.</p>
    <h2>It’s a trap!</h2>
    <p>
    	The first aspects to understand about using a Proxy are handlers and traps. We can create a
    	handler to trap a series of operations, e.g. get(), set(), and apply(). In essence, we’ll get a
    	chance to intercept those operations on the object we’re wrapping and do with them whatever we
    	want—we can return different values depending on some logic, or simply forward the operation to
    	the original target.
    </p>
    <p>
    	As a simple example, we can always return the same value regardless of what property you try to
    	access, even if no property has been set on the original object:
    </p>
    <pre />
    <h2>Always return a function</h2>
    <p>
    	This enables us to completely change how an object works. To enable chaining for the style
    	object, we’ll expand get to also work as set. We’ll still only trap get, but rather than
    	returning the value of a property when it’s accessed we’ll return a function that returns the
    	value of the property only if the function is invoked without any arguments. If an argument is
    	passed, we’ll use it to update that property’s value.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Let’s start by just getting the basics into place. Let’s create a new handler called getProxy,
    	and create a get trap, where we always return a function. Thus if we just log a property, we’ll
    	get a function. But if we invoke that function, we’ll see what it returns (in this case “test”):
    </p>

    <h2>Use the function to get and set values</h2>
    <p>
    	Inside our new function, we can check if an argument is being passed to it when it’s invoked. If
    	something is passed, we can use that argument to update the property. If no arguments are passed
    	we can simply return the value of that property, basically maintaining the original get
    	functionality while expanding it with a set option.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Let’s create a new Proxy, this time called styleProxy. We’ll check if something is being passed
    	to it, and get and set accordingly. Our proxy handler is also being passed an object (the object
    	we’re wrapping and intercepting) and a property argument (the property we’re operating on), and
    	we can use these two to operate on the original target.
    </p>

    <p>This enables our handler’s get method to act both as a setter and getter:</p>
    <pre>
    style(".menu").color("#fff"); // Gets a function which updates color to "#fff"
    style(".menu").color();       // No arguments passed, just returns "#fff"

</pre>
	<p>
		Note that since we’re not creating a trap for the set operation, we can still set a property’s
		value by assigning a value to it directly:
	</p>
	<pre>
	// Works like expected
	style(".menu").color = "#fff";
</pre>
	<h2>Return the style object wrapped in a proxy</h2>
	<p>
		Now that we’re in control of what’s being returned after we update a property, we can simply
		return the original style object wrapped in our Proxy handler if an argument is passed,
		completing our chaining method:
	</p>

    <p>When we use method chaining, then, this is what’s happening behind the scenes:</p>
    <pre>
    style(".menu")              // Returns the style object in a Proxy
    .color("#fff")            // Updates color and returns a Proxy
    .backgroundColor("#000")  // Updates bgColor and returns a Proxy
    .opacity("1");            // ... and so on so forth

</pre>
	<p>Here’s the solution in full:</p>

    <p>
    	I can’t confidently say that I recommend this approach—and I won’t be using it on this site
    	anytime soon due to the just-too-low browser support, but I find it fascinating how bendable
    	JavaScript is, and how with the Proxy API we can go even further.
