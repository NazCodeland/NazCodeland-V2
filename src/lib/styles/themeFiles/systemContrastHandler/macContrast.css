Mac OS users will get a light or dark theme of the website based on their
OS light/dark mode options. Since the dark and light themes on the website are
based on light/dark contrast themes, if a MAC OS user wishes less/more contrast
they can choose from one of those themes. That is how 
prefers-contrast: more and `prefers-contrast: less` is handled.
