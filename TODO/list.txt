-:> tabbing index isn't working as expected, check it out once site is done
-:> add border around what-i-do cards

ACCESSIBILITY:
	-> make <abbr> element mobile/keyboard accessible

-:> generate the blog article images using AI, midJourney
-:> Check for accessibility issues once the site is done,
-:> check for prefers-less-motion
-:> Make sure typescript code contains typechecking

-:> How to give each blog a "Views" and "TimeToRead" properties that update.
		-> ideas, they need to be stored on a database
		-> the views should be based on IP address
		-> TimeToRead should be based on some text to speech at human readable speed

-> nav is broken when you shrink screen
-> convert svg components into svg files
-> give the palettes a title
-> when you scroll down, body content shows on the side of the header when it scrolls behind it

- Perhaps colorSchemeAndThemePaletteStore can be broken up into two stores
since the logic of these two components is not intertwined anymore

- navStore.ts and ThemePaletteStore.ts have 95% same functionality. Should
I turn it into one function if not possible, should I move them into one file?

- once viewport goes over 1440, font size doesn't increase, adjust that

--------------------------------------------------------------------
ColorSchemeStore has stores in two different locations. One is in the root of
lib and the other within the ColorScheme component folder.

the value of the store in the folder only impacts it's nested component. On
hover, the nested component shows up. What's tricky is that the lib/stores
store for ColorScheme has the same name as the folder store, but they don't 
clash because its in two different locations.

Question, since there is already a global colorScheme store should I also
move the folder store there?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I can set attributes/classes on the HTML element from within the store, why are we 
choosing to do it with an actions? it feels like the store code should
set the attribute/class on the HTML element instead of disconnecting it out to an actions?
